# Webpipe

This will be a web extension that tries to bring the interoperability of terminal's pipes into ~~GUIs~~ webs

This is just a ~~rant~~ proof of concept, and definitely unrelated to OS's GUIs ecosystem and their failure to make interoperability practical, [it's all just a coincidence](https://twitter.com/madacol/status/1493602869659979789)

My hope is ~~to poke some nerves in the OS's community~~ to inspire users to interconnect ~~web~~-apps, compose them and build on top of their own creations or other's, and in many cases, without even coding.
